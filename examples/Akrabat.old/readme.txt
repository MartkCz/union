Nette Framework example "Akrabat 1.0"
-------------------------------------

Classic Zend Framework Tutorial rewritten for Nette.
Nette\Forms are not used here for simplicity (or complexity :-).

The example shows an important feature of the Nette Framework: the URLs are
not used inside the application including the templates. The URLs are in
responsibility of the router and can be changed anytime. The target of a link
is always a combination "Presenter:action" or "Presenter:signal!".
